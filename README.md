# 🚗 Car Game

## Overview
The Car Game is an exciting, web-based arcade game created by Roshan Kumar Prajapati. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it challenges players to navigate a car through a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles and earning points. The game features three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), a score display, and start/restart controls. Rendered on a canvas, it is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, offering a thrilling and engaging driving experience.

## Features
- **Gameplay** 🎮:
  - Players control a car, maneuvering it to avoid obstacles and collect points within a canvas-based environment.
  - Score increases based on survival time or collected items, displayed in real-time (`score`).
- **Difficulty Levels** 🎚️:
  - **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** modes, selectable via buttons (`easyButton`, `mediumButton`, `hardButton`), adjusting speed, obstacle frequency, or other parameters.
- **Controls** 🕹️:
  - Start and restart buttons (`startButton`, `restartButton`) to initiate or reset the game.
  - Likely keyboard (e.g., arrow keys) or touch controls for car movement, implemented in `game.js`.
- **Score Display** 📊:
  - Real-time score tracking shown in the score display (`score`).
- **Canvas Rendering** 🖼️:
  - Game visuals, including the car, obstacles, and background, are rendered on a canvas (`gameCanvas`).
- **Responsive Design** 📱:
  - Optimized for various screen sizes with flexible layouts and dynamic canvas sizing.
- **Visual Design** 🎨:
  - Clean interface with styled buttons and score display, customizable via `styles.css`.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game, including canvas, controls, and score display.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the game container, buttons, score display, and responsive layout (`styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including car movement, obstacle generation, collision detection, score tracking, and canvas rendering (`game.js`).
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering the car, obstacles, and game environment.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with Canvas and JavaScript support.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for customization.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Roshan/car-game.git
cd car-game
```

### 2. Open the Website
- Open `index.html` in a web browser:
  ```bash
  open index.html  # macOS
  start index.html  # Windows
  ```
- Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for better performance.

### 3. Customize (Optional)
- Edit `styles.css` to modify the game container, button styles, or score display (e.g., colors, animations).
- Update `game.js` to enhance gameplay (e.g., add sound effects, new obstacle types, or power-ups).
- Modify `index.html` to add features like a pause button, high score display, or additional UI elements.

## Usage
1. **Select Difficulty** 🎚️: Choose Easy, Medium, or Hard by clicking the respective button.
2. **Start Game** 🚀: Click the "Start Game" button (appears after difficulty selection) to begin.
3. **Control Car** 🚗: Use keyboard (e.g., arrow keys) or touch controls to navigate the car, avoiding obstacles.
4. **Score Points** 📊: Earn points based on survival or collected items, shown in the score display.
5. **Restart** 🔄: Click the "Restart Game" button to reset the game when it ends.
6. **Responsive** 📱: Play on desktop or mobile for a consistent experience.

## Deployment
- **Static Hosting**:
  1. Upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `game.js` to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
  2. Configure the service to serve `index.html` as the entry point.
- **GitHub Pages Example**:
  1. Push the repository to GitHub.
  2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the `main` branch.
  3. Access the site at `https://the-roshan.github.io/car-game`.
- **Netlify Example**:
  1. Drag the project folder into Netlify’s dashboard.
  2. Deploy and use the provided URL.
- **Local Server**:
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
  Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes
- **JavaScript Logic**: The `game.js` file must implement:
  - Car movement based on keyboard or touch input.
  - Obstacle generation with varying frequency/speed based on difficulty.
  - Collision detection between the car and obstacles.
  - Score calculation and update.
  - Game loop using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth rendering.
  - Game state management (start, restart, game over).
- **Styling**: The `styles.css` file should define styles for the game container, canvas, buttons, score display, and responsive layout.
- **Enhancements**: Consider adding:
  - Sound effects for collisions, scoring, or engine sounds.
  - High score storage using `localStorage`.
  - Power-ups (e.g., speed boosts, shields) for varied gameplay.
  - Background elements (e.g., road, scenery) or sprite-based graphics for the car and obstacles.
  - A game over screen with final score and restart prompt.
- **SEO**: Add meta tags in `<head>` (e.g., `description`, `keywords`) for better visibility, e.g., "Car Game by Roshan Kumar Prajapati".
- **License**: Include the MIT License in `LICENSE.md` to clarify usage terms (as provided previously).
- **Performance**: Ensure the canvas rendering and game loop are optimized for smooth performance, especially on mobile devices.
